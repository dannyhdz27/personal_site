            <p>
              I'm a recent coding bootcamp graduate! Prior to my shift into full
              stack development, I was a website consultant where I worked
              collaboratively with web developers and graphic designers to
              create impactful websites for small and medium-sized business
              owners.
            </p>
            <p>
              My growing interest in coding led me to pursue a career in
              software engineering. Starting with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of
              Bootstrap, I realized that I wanted to dive deeper into the world
              of programming. After much consideration, I decided to jump into
              this course to enhance my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I'm actively learning and building upon the skills I
              acquired at the bootcamp. I am eager to apply my knowledge and am
              always seeking opportunities to further grow as a developer. My
              main goal is to contribute to meaningful projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of the future, I envision myself working as part of a
              collaborative team, leveraging my skills and expertise to create
              fun and innovative applications. I am open to exploring various
              industries and companies, as long as they align with my passion
              for using technology to solve problems and, of course, make a
              positive impact.
