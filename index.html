      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          I'm a recent coding bootcamp graduate! Prior to my shift into full
          stack development, I was a website consultant where I worked
          collaboratively with web developers and graphic designers to create
          impactful websites for small and medium-sized business owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          My growing interest in coding led me to pursue a career in software
          engineering. Starting with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Bootstrap, I
          realized that I wanted to dive deeper into the world of programming.
          After much consideration, I decided to jump into a coding bootcamp to
          enhance my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I'm actively learning and building upon the skills I
          acquired at the bootcamp. I am eager to apply my knowledge and am
          always seeking opportunities to further grow as a developer. My main
          goal is to contribute to meaningful projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of the future, I envision myself working as part of a
          collaborative team, leveraging my skills and expertise to create fun
          and innovative applications. I am open to exploring various industries
          and companies, as long as they align with my passion for using
          technology to solve problems and, of course, make a positive impact.
